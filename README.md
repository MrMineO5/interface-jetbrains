## What is this?

<!-- Plugin description -->

This project contains the JetBrains IDE plugin for [Source++](https://github.com/sourceplusplus/live-platform), the open-source live coding platform. This plugin also works with regular [SkyWalking](https://github.com/apache/skywalking) installations, but only [Live View](#live-view) commands are currently supported.

<!-- Plugin description end -->

## How to use?

Install this plugin via the JetBrains Marketplace by searching for: `Source++`.

Once installed, this plugin adds the [Live Command Palette](https://docs.sourceplus.plus/features/live-commands/#live-command-palette) to the JetBrains IDE, which is accessible by typing `Ctrl+Shift+S`. The available commands are determined by the location of the live command palette and the accessibility of [Apache SkyWalking](https://github.com/apache/skywalking) or the [Source++ Platform](https://github.com/sourceplusplus/live-platform).

For more information, please see the [documentation](https://docs.sourceplus.plus/features/).
