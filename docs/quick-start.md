# Usage



## Source Mark

*Source Marks* are one of the central components of SourceMarker. *Source Marks* are used to give developers a quick indication about the current behavior of a given source code artifact. These markings are placed in and around source code text to indicate there is additional information that can be viewed about that specific source code artifact.



## Source Portal

The *Source Portal* is the primary visual interface of SourceMarker. It is a dynamic and contextual interface that displays visualizations relevant to the source code currently in focus. 

To view the *Source Portal* you can click any visible *Source Mark* or you can type the keyboard combination:

```
CONTROL+SHIFT+S
```

Doing so will trigger the *Source Portal* to display directly above the artifact for which the information correlates, like so:
